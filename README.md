A typeface combining the Sinhala and Tamil letters. This project is not about solving the political problems in the country, but it is to explore the different graphical aspects of cultural boundaries between ethnicities in Sri Lanka and an attempt to dissolve these boundaries in a selected context.

The ethnic conflicts in Sri Lanka surfaced in a new form as a language problem in 1950’s and eventually it led to a series of unfortunate events which included much political turmoil and a 30 year long war. It is evident that the damage has been done and in the light of peace in Sri Lanka, the ethnic tension continues to grow.

This project is not about solving the political problems in the country, but to explore the different graphical aspects of cultural boundaries between ethnicities in Sri Lanka and an attempt to dissolve these boundaries in a selected context.

The main boundary between cultures is the language and it happens that both Sinhala and tableamil languages come from the same branch of Indic languages. The two ethnicities share many similar pronunciation of words as well. A deeper look into the visual properties of the two alphabets, and their development prompts that there is a possibility of building a one set of letters to be used for both languages essentially blurring out the language barrier on a different level.

Both the Sinhala and Tamil alphabets and writing systems were simplified and changed to accommodate the idea of hybrid letters. Basically this is a new writing system based on Sinhala and Tamil that could be easily learnt by the both ethnicities.The second phase of the project is using this developed writing system in an urban street which has a high Tamil population density and try and make the street more familiar to a Sinhala audience.


සහජීවනය අපහසු නැත. වෙනස්කම් වෙනුවට සමානකම් දකින්නට හැකිනම් එදිනට අප දෙදෙනාටම එකම ලෝකයක ජීවත් වන්නට හැකිවනු ඇත. මම ඔබේ ලොවේත් ඔබ මගේ ලොවෙත් අනෙකෙකු කලේ අප ගොඩනැගූ සංස්කෘතිය මිස ලේ, මස්, ඇට නහර නොවේ. අපහසු වන්නේ සහජීවනය නොව , ඒ බෙදා වෙන්කරන වෙනස්කම් වල සැබෑ ස්වරූපය හඳුනා ගැනීමයි.

මේ සිංහල දෙමල අප බෙදා වෙන්කළ භාෂාවේ බාධකය හඳුනා ගැනීමක්.

சமாதானம் இயலாத ஒன்றல்ல. எம்மைச் சூழவுள்ள பொருட்களுக்கிடையே உள்ள வேறுபாடுகளை விடுத்து ஒற்றுமையினை அறிய முற்படுகையில் வாழ்க்கையில் மகிழ்ச்சி கிடைக்கின்றது. தனித்துவ குழுமங்கள் வெவ்வேறு கலாசார பாரம்பரியத்தினால் கட்டி எழுப்பப்பட்டவை. வேறுபடுவது கலாசாரமே அன்றி நாம் அல்ல. இந்த இயற்கை நியதியைப் புரிந்து கொள்கின்ற பொழுது சமாதானம் இயலாத ஒன்றல்ல.

இத்தளம் சிங்கள தமிழ் மொழிகளுக்கிடையேயான ஒன்றித்த அம்சங்களை இனங்காணுகின்ற ஒரு தேடல்.
